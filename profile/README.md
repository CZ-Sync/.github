## Welcome to the CZ-Sync GitHub space 👋

The **CZ-Sync GitHub Organization** contains code repositories associated with the CZ Synchrony Working Group, which is a Powell Center working group. More details will be added as we begin working on this project.

Repo guide and organization:
- `code-sandbox` is a repo for putting test, example, or one-off code snippets
- `data-preprocessing` is a repo with a formal `targets` pipeline used to download, gather, harmonize, and munge any input data for later use in modeling. The data prepared through this repo's pipeline are pushed to Google Drive.
- `model-[domain]-[method]` refer to repos that contain modeling code (e.g. `model-streamflow-bayes`, `model-streamflow-lstm`). These repos are named following that convention to maintain organization.
